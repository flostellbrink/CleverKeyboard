This app is for everyone who uses keyboards with different layouts on windows.
As you'll know windows won't remember what layout belongs to which keyboard.

We can change that. This app will choose the correct keyboard every time you press a key.
All you have to do is choose which layout belongs to which keyboard.

The app runs in the background to keep your layout updated. You can always make it show up again by double clicking the notification icon.

The UI is built with the wonderful [ModernWPF UI Library](https://github.com/Kinnara/ModernWpf).

The notification icon is done with help from [Hardcodet NotifyIcon for WPF](https://github.com/hardcodet/wpf-notifyicon).

Settings are serialized and stored in JSON using [Newtonsoft Json.Net](https://github.com/JamesNK/Newtonsoft.Json).
